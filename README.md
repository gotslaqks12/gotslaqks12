### Hello This is Ryan!

---

I am a software engineer focusing on full-stack web development. I'm learning new skills every day in a coding bootcamp, and am really excited to be in the field. 
The more I study, the more my passion grows. In addition to coding, I have 6 years of experience working in customer service. 
That field taught me how to work with all types of people and handle situations responsibility and efficiently. 
Now I want to apply these skills to the field of software engineering. I look forward to learn more and more!
